  abstract = {Structured Abstract Authors – Batra P, Kharbanda OP, Duggal R, Singh N, Parkash H Objectives – The aim of the study was to investigate alkaline phosphatase activity in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) during orthodontic tooth movement in humans. Setting and Sample Population – Postgraduate orthodontic clinic. Ten female patients requiring all first premolar extractions were selected and treated with standard edgewise mechanotherapy. Experimental Variable – Canine retraction was done using 100 g sentalloy springs. Maxillary canine on one side acted as experimental site while the contralateral canine acted as control. Outcome Measure – Gingival crevicular fluid was collected from mesial and distal of canines before initiation of canine retraction (baseline), immediately after initiation of retraction, and on 1st, 7th, 14th and 21st day and the alkaline phosphatase activity was estimated. Results – The results show significant (p {$<$} 0.05) changes in alkaline phosphatase activity on the 7th, 14th and 21st day on both mesial and distal aspects of the compared experimental and control sides. The peak in enzyme activity occurred on the 14th day of initiation of retraction followed by a significant fall in activity especially on the mesial aspect. Conclusions – The study showed that alkaline phosphatase activity could be successfully estimated in the GCF using calorimetric estimation assay kits. The enzyme activity showed variation according to the amount of tooth movement.},

  abstract = {In this contribution a highly cost-effective flow analysis system for determination of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity is presented. This fully-mechanized bioanalytical system is based on economic solenoid micropumps and microvalves (powered and actuated by Arduino microcontroller) and extremely cheap dedicated optoelectronic flow-through detectors allowing absorbance and fluorescence measurements. The detection schemes for ALP assaying realized in this system are based on orthophosphate determination. For the detection of these ions formed in the course of enzymatic conversion a molybdate method requiring only common and inexpensive chemicals is utilized. Thus, for the enzymatic assays the simplest not-chromogenic/not-fluorogenic ALP substrates can be applied. Such approach results in the use of low-cost reagents for ALP assays, whereas the mechanization of assay causes low consumption of reagents as well as samples. In the course of reported investigations six ALP substrates were examined and the most promising results have been obtained for the inorganic compound – monofluorophosphate (MFP). The obtained linear ranges of absorbance and fluorescence measurements are 100–600\,U\,L−1 and 30-30/30-100\,U\,L−1, with sensitivities of 0.7\,mV\,L−1 U−1 and 2.3/1.0\,mV\,L−1 U−1, respectively. The calculated limits of detection are 5.1\,U\,L−1 (photometry) and 0.9\,U\,L−1 (fluorometry). The throughputs of the developed system are 13 and 12 samples/h for photometric and fluorometric detections, respectively. To demonstrate the practical utility of the developed bioanalytical system the ALP assays in complex matrix samples have been carried out. The results of ALP activity determination in serum samples are well-correlated with those obtained using reference method recommended for routine clinical analysis.},

  abstract = {Intestinal alkaline phosphatases (IAPs) are involved in the cleavage of phosphate prodrugs to liberate the drug for absorption in the intestine. To facilitate in vitro characterization of phosphate prodrugs, we have cloned, expressed, purified and characterized IAPs from rat and cynomolgus monkey (rIAP and cIAP respectively) which are important pre-clinical species for drug metabolism studies. The recombinant rat and monkey enzymes expressed in Sf9 insect cells (IAP-Ic) were found to be glycosylated and active. Expression of rat IAP in Escherichia coli (rIAP-Ec) led to ∼200-fold loss of activity that was partially recovered by the addition of external Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions. Crystal structures of rIAP-Ec and rIAP-Ic were determined and they provide rationale for the discrepancy in enzyme activities. Rat IAP-Ic retains its activity in presence of both Zn2+ and Mg2+ whereas activity of most other alkaline phosphatases (APs) including the cIAP was strongly inhibited by excess Zn2+. Based on our crystal structure, we hypothesized the residue Q317 in rIAP, present within 7Å of the Mg2+ at M3, to be important for this difference in activity. The Q317H rIAP and H317Q cIAP mutants showed reversal in effect of Zn2+, corroborating the hypothesis. Further analysis of the two structures indicated a close linkage between glycosylation and crown domain stability. A triple mutant of rIAP, where all the three putative N-linked glycosylation sites were mutated showed thermal instability and reduced activity.},

  abstract = {Overall and cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is greatly increased, without obvious current effective treatments. Mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is a common manifestation of CKD and contributes to the high risk of fracture and cardiovascular mortality in these patients. Traditionally, clinical management of CKD-MBD focused on attenuation of secondary hyperparathyroidism due to impaired renal activation of vitamin D and phosphate retention, although recently, adynamic forms of renal bone disease have become more prevalent. Definitive diagnosis was based on histologic (histomorphometric) analysis of bone biopsy material supported by radiologic changes and changes in levels of surrogate laboratory markers. Of these various markers, parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been considered to be the most sensitive and currently is the most frequently used; however, the many pitfalls of measuring PTH in patients with CKD increasingly are appreciated. We propose an alternative or complementary approach using bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which is directly related to bone turnover, reflects bone histomorphometry, and predicts outcomes in hemodialysis patients. Here, we consider the overall merits of bone ALP as a marker of bone turnover in adults with CKD-MBD, examine published bone histomorphometric data comparing bone ALP to PTH, and discuss possible pathogenic mechanisms by which bone ALP may be linked to outcomes in patients with CKD.},
